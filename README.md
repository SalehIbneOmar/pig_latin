# pig_latin
a secret language formed from English by transferring the initial consonant or consonant cluster of each word to the end of the word and adding a vocalic syllable (usually eÉª): so igpay atinlay.

Translate English to Pig Latin by following these two simple rules:

1. If the word begins with a consonant, then move the first consonant or group of consonants to the end of the word and add "ay."       For example, "dusty" becomes "usty-day" and "choice" becomes "oice-chay."
2. If the word begins with a vowel, then just add "yay," "hay," "way," or "ay" to the end of the word, depending on your regional dialect. (I prefer the "yay" style.) For example, "apple" becomes "apple-yay" and "orange" becomes "orange-yay."
